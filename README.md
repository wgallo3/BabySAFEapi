EASIEST possible SAFE Network API, copy and paste various buttons THAT WORK :)<br>
Download <a href="https://github.com/wgallo3/BabySAFEapi/blob/master/index.html">the index.html file above</a> to begin filling it in. Test it on Alpha 2 and use the <a href="http://docs.maidsafe.net/beaker-plugin-safe-app/">API docs here</a>.

# To Do:
 - Make the various buttons ACTUALLY WORK :P 
 - Upload, Display files, public / private, login /out, etc
 - Separate code into < div> 's, so that it's super easy to copy parts
 - **Separate this project into sections, Upload &view part = $200, Messages = $100, NFS part = $100**
 
# Goals:
The goal of this project is to make the #1 EASIEST API for the SAFE Network, so anyone can copy and paste WORKING BUTTONS into their projects / apps / websites. Making it as easy, organized, and divided as possible is the main goal, so that people can just copy exactly what they need to make simple apps / websites on SAFE.

**Paying $400 of my personal savings to get this done for the community.**
Can pay in crypto if needed.
